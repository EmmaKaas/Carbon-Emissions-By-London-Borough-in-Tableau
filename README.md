#  üçÄCarbon Emissions By London Borough in Tableau  üçÄ

In this project I used a sample dataset from Tableau's sample dataset called 'CO2 Emissions by London Borough (2005-2014)' and explored the data using visualisations in Tableau. In addition to this dataset I also used 'Statistical GIS Boundary Files for London' which is available from data.gov.uk for the map visualisation showing the emission rates for each london borough.



# Final Dashboard

My dashboard is also published on my Tableau public account if you would like to take a closer look!
